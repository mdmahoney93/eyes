# EYES

## This is a fun (maybe a little creepy) interactive exercise that shows a pair of "eye balls" that follow your mouse around the screen. To see it work, just open the html, put your mouse on the page and move it around the screen... you should see two red and yellow eyes following your mouse. 

### Something to improve on... I was trying to make a third eye and it seemed difficult for me. It wasn't allowing me to do that and keep the other two eyes moving. I'd like to know how fill the screen with eyes and have them all move with your mouse.. or maybe even blink!
